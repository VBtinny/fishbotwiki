20% of all fish sold by players will end up in the `fishmarkets` and will be avaliable for purchase by players.

- `!fishmarkets` to see what fish are available and how much stock
- You can only purchase from the fishmarkets between payday 0 and payday 30
- Members of the fishingguild can purchase from fishmarkets up until payday 41
- Usage: `!buy trout 27` would buy 27x trout from the fishmarkets.
