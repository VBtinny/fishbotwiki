# Player Shops

**NOTE: THIS IS ALL NOT IN THE GAME YET, COMING SOON**

The player shops allow a way for users to sell their spare goods or hauls to other players, without the need for being online and active, or for a trust trade.

Items available for sale are viewable on the stream overlay or on the fishbot.app website.
