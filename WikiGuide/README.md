- The changes will end up on the Fishbot.app website within 5 mins max

- It doesnt need to be perfect, fancy or pretty. Any contributions are *very much appreciated*.

- If you copy an image from somewhere you can paste it into the github editor and it will auto upload and embed

- imo, best way to work is to copy and paste something from another segment and then change the info 

- If you wanna get fancy, see [this guide which helps to understand markdown and how to use it.](https://support.squarespace.com/hc/en-us/articles/206543587-Markdown-cheat-sheet)

- Be respectful and responsible!
