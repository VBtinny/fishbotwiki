# Thieving #

Thieving is the art of targetting a known location, to extract items, coins or fish.

Each time you thieve:
- You must have a lockpick in your inventory
- You will need to wait 1 hour to thieve again, but this can be reduced
- You have a chance of hitting the [Thieving Unique Droptable]

With the right items:
- You have a chance of 'double thieving', which hits the thieve location twice
- You have a chance of a 'cooldown reset', which does *not* apply the one hour thieving cooldown
